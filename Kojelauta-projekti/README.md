# Learning - Kojelauta

These files include the files that I created alone or with somebody for our project www.kojelauta.com, which was done as a final project for Academic Work Academy's Java course.

If something is commented out, it is because it is someone else's code but it helps to understand the code.

The languages I used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java.
